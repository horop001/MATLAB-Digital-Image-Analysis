Reading TIF files and grayscaling

% Write a MATLAB script that clears the current workspace, reads 
% the image “BLUE.tif” into the current workspace, and displays 
% the image as a grayscale.

clc; //clears workspace

A = imread('BLUE.tif') ;    % assigns image to variable A

image(A, 'CDatamapping', 'scaled') ;  % adjusts colormapping to scaled
colorbar ;                 % adds color bar
colormap gray ;            % adjusts colormapping to grayscale
